This code is aimed at MCMC identification of evaporation rate coefficients from time-dependent cluster concentrations taken at varying background concentrations of
sulphuric acid and ammonia monomers. Evaporation rates with symbols and initial values (taken from quantum chemistry computations are listed in the Table 1 of the Supplementary pdf.

Time spans are stored in 'time_1_5_min_1_40h' and similar formatted files, where 1_5_min means that the concentrations were measured every 1.5 minutes.
This files contain time instants at which the measurements are available.

first compile (run 'make')
next, run './mcmcrun'
