This code is aimed at MCMC identification of evaporation rate coefficients from steady-state cluster concentrations taken at varying background concentrations of
sulphuric acid and ammonia monomers. Evaporation rates with symbols and initial values (taken from quantum chemistry computations are listed in the Table 2 of the Supplementary pdf.

first compile (run 'make')
next, run './mcmcrun'
