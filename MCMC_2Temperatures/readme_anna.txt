This code is aimed at MCMC identification of enthalpies and entropies (for each of the 14 cluster included into the system) from steady-state cluster concentrations taken at two different temperatures under varying background concentrations of
sulphuric acid and ammonia monomers. Parameters employed for identification with symbols and initial values (taken from quantum chemistry computations are listed in the Table 2 of the Supplementary pdf.
